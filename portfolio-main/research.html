                <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
                <p>My research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on developing advanced models and algorithms for understanding and generating human language. This includes exploring various NLP tasks such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.</li>
                    <li>Sentiment Analysis: Identifying and extracting subjective information from text.</li>
                    <li>Named Entity Recognition: Detecting and classifying proper names in text.</li>
                    <li>Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another using automated systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In my work, I utilize state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT, and other transformer-based architectures to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of NLP applications.</p>

                <h3>Digital Humanities and Contextual Embedding</h3>
                <p>My research in Digital Humanities integrates computational techniques with the study of human culture and history. A significant focus of my work is on contextual embedding, which involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contextual Analysis: Using embeddings to understand the nuanced meanings of words and phrases within specific cultural and historical contexts.</li>
                    <li>Textual Analysis: Applying NLP methods to large corpora of historical texts to uncover patterns and insights.</li>
                    <li>Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Working with scholars from the humanities to apply computational tools to traditional humanities research questions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By leveraging contextual embeddings, I aim to bridge the gap between quantitative analysis and qualitative interpretation, providing richer and more nuanced insights into humanistic studies.</p>
